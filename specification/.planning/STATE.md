# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-01)

**Core value:** The specification must be comprehensive and precise enough that an OXC implementation can be built from it without referencing the SWC source code.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core Pipeline Specification

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Core Pipeline Specification)
Plan: 4 of 5 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-01

Progress: [####░░░░░░] 40%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~5m
- Total execution time: ~0.25 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Spec phases split into 4 incremental phases (core pipeline -> JSX/props -> build modes -> API/bindings) rather than one monolithic phase
- [Roadmap]: Implementation split into 2 phases (core transform -> strategies/modes/bindings) per research recommendation
- [Phase 01]: Spec document follows pipeline execution order with 6 stage groupings (D-01)
- [Phase 01 P03]: Capture analysis uses 8-category taxonomy with self-import reclassification as first-class pattern
- [Phase 01 P03]: All 16 capture edge cases documented as named spec test cases (CAPTURE-EDGE-01 through 16)
- [Phase 01]: Segment Extraction documented as 8-step new_module pipeline with captures injection, topological sort, and deduplication
- [Phase 01]: Import Rewriting documented as 4 distinct mechanisms (legacy rename, consumed stripping, synthetic addition, per-segment resolution)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- NAPI v3 WASM browser target needs early validation (Phase 5 timeframe) to confirm viability before Phase 6 binding work
- JSX transform has 16 known edge cases around event handler capture scoping — research pass recommended before Phase 2 planning
